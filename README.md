A E-commerce  online furniture store (front-end)
I took this porject on my own to build a online  fruniture store for my client.
I am trying to collect all the information from online everywhere without a good experience on programming languages.
Providing all the details of the product,tags company information handling deal online is really a big task for me, taking this as a challenge i want to handle all the product related queries companies policy and almost everything.
The tools i am using to complete this project is HTML5,CSS3,BOOTSTRAP,JAVASCRIPT for front end
For backend i tried connecting to database using MYSQL and PHP.
connecting to database is a big challenge to me and handling online payment mode.
Yet my project is incomplete.
I am working on this project all alone with great Zeal and positiveness .
If any one of you can contribute to my project  then please....
it will be a great help for me..
